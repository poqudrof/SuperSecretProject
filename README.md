Ideas: 

* Node & graphical coding with real code. 
* All is open source. The idea is to obtain good code, easy to read and to write. 
* The graphics are in Ruby-Processing and ControlP5 custom.
* Create patches of text, make boxes with same. 
* Bam, we have a vvvv, but open-source, 100% live code and based on Processing.


## How to start : 

* Install jruby. 
* Install ruby-processing. 
* Install processing 2.2.1, and controlP5 from https://github.com/potioc/ControlP5
