Ideas: 

* Use Emacs to do live coding in Ruby !
* Ruby-Processing looks awesome. 
* Use ControlP5 in Ruby-Processing. Create a ruby introspection module (or monkey patch) for ControlP5. 
* Create a Ruby-Processing with ControlP5 and IRB or PRY as REPL. 
* Create patches of text, make boxes with same. 
* Bam, we have a vvvv, but open-source, 100% live code and based on Processing.
